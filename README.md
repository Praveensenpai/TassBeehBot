## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Praveensenpai/TassBeehBot.git
cd TassBeehBot
```

### 2. Install `uv` Package Manager

**Windows:**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Linux/macOS:**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 3. Sync Dependencies with `uv`

```bash
uv sync
```

### 4. Obtain `WebAppData.txt`

To get the necessary session data for authentication, follow these steps:

- **Open the TassBeeh Bot App** in Telegram.
- **Open Chrome Developer Tools**:
  - Right-click on the page â†’ **Inspect** (or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Opt+I`).
- **Go to the Application Tab** in the Developer Tools window.
- **Select 'Session Storage'** from the left menu.
- **Find the entry for `https://app.tassbeeh.com`**.
- **Copy the value of the `tgWebAppData` key** (which starts with `query_id`).
- **Create a `WebAppData.txt` file** in the project directory and paste the copied data.

The contents of `WebAppData.txt` should look like this:

```plaintext
query_id=AAGtu1oyAAAAAK27WjIxngei&...
```

## Running the Bot

To run the bot, execute the following command:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

The bot will log in using the `WebAppData.txt` data, claim points, and repeat the process based on the app's refill intervals.
